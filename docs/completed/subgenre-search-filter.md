# Searchable Subgenre Dropdown

## Issue

The subgenre dropdown currently only supports alphabetical navigation (typing "i" jumps to items starting with "I"). This makes it difficult to discover related subgenres that may be in different categories or start with different letters.

## Problem Scenarios

1. **Keyword-based discovery**: Searching for "instrumental" should show all instrumental-related subgenres, regardless of category:
   - "Instrumental Hip-Hop" (under Hip-Hop)
   - "Global Instrumentals" (under World Music)
   - "Piano Instrumental" (under Classical/Ambient)

2. **Missed opportunities**: Curators may miss more suitable subgenres because they're alphabetically distant from the one they're considering

3. **Tagging errors**: Reviewing and re-tagging tracks after realizing a better subgenre exists elsewhere in the list

## Requested Behavior

Replace or enhance the dropdown with:
- Type-to-search functionality
- Filter subgenres by partial keyword match (e.g., "instru" matches "Instrumental Hip-Hop", "Global Instrumentals")
- Show results from all categories, not just alphabetical neighbors
- Highlight matching text in results

## Impact

- Faster subgenre discovery
- Reduces tagging errors and subsequent corrections
- Helps curators learn the full subgenre taxonomy
- Improves classification accuracy

## User Feedback

> "On the drop down menu for the genres/sub-genres. It might be more useful for curators to be able to search vs list the genres alphabetically only. For example if I type 'i' it'll drop to everything starting with I.. But if i could search for 'instrumental' I can see all the sub-genres on our list that are instrumental-based as opposed to trying to search alphabetically only. It would save time and help avoid errors where I had to go back and re-tag because I realized there was a more suitable 'instrumental' sub genre but for example it was under 'global instrumentals' (i.e. under G alphabetically) but i just missed it."
