# Bulk Tagging / Batch Classification

## Issue

When reviewing playlists where all tracks share the same characteristics (e.g., "Morning - Ambient Piano - Low Energy"), curators must manually tag each track individually with identical values. This becomes tedious for large playlists with 500+ tracks.

## Requested Behavior

Ability to:
1. Select multiple tracks using checkboxes
2. Apply the same classification to all selected tracks at once:
   - Energy level
   - Accessibility
   - Subgenres (1-3)
   - Explicit content rating
3. Bulk approve/save all selected tracks

## Use Cases

- Homogeneous playlists (e.g., all Ambient Piano, all Low Energy)
- Genre-specific crates sorted by energy on Spotify
- New release batches pre-organized by characteristics
- Coordinated curation workflows where tracks are pre-sorted externally

## Impact

- Dramatically reduces time for homogeneous playlists
- Eliminates repetitive manual tagging of identical attributes
- Enables new curation workflows (batch upload pre-sorted tracks)

## User Feedback

> "It would be great to select all tracks and batch tag. This week, 2 of my playlists were all the same energy, same genres, same tags overall. (For example, Morning - Ambient Piano - Low Energy). It would be cool in the future to be able to select all tracks, and tag everything as the same. This will be particularly useful for when Michaela and I coordinate on my primarily focusing on genre crates for new releases. Easier to just separate them by energy on Spotify itself and then batch upload and batch tag the tracks. Right now it was like tagging the same thing over and over again for 500+ tracks for example."
